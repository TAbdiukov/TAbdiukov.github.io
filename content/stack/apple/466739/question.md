# Question

This problem is very similar to [How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools? - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/308743/369389), with the following additional limitations,

* **Mac OS X `v10.6.x` Snow Leopard** must not be upgraded.
* Because of old Mac OS X or otherwise, **Boot Camp Assistant does not function properly.**
* Because of old Mac OS X, old version of Boot Camp or Boot Camp Assistant, old/poorly supported hardware, old/poorly supported firmware, or otherwise, **your Mac crashes in [Windows GUI setup](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2006/05/vistab2/2/)** (or even in [EasyBCD BIOS Extender](https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-boot-from-usb-drive-even-if-your-pc-doesnt-support-booting-from-usb/), "if your PC doesn’t support booting from USB.")
* Because of old Mac OS X or otherwise, **custom boot managers don't function properly** - with Windows failing to perform the boot into *any* GUI, before or after installation.

This Q&A answers how to install Windows 7 (**and beyond, e.g. Windows 10**) onto a mid-2010 Mac mini with Mac OS X Snow Leopard without Boot Camp or an optical (DVD) drive.

**This is a question with *specific constraints*** (pertinent to Mac OS X Snow Leopard compatibility). If these additional limitations don't apply to you, then you should likely follow: [How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools? - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/308743/369389)

I would desire to perform the installation ***without*** any of the following.

- <s>No third-party software</s> *(Third-party software, if any, should be minimal, and it should work with Mac OS X Snow Leopard)*
- No optical (DVD) drive 
- No Boot Camp Assistant or it cannot be used properly.
