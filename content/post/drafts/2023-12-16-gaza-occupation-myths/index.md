I took the liberty to enhance information with more details. Most such details are marked with: **★** or [**★** *section*].

# Myth 1/3: Israel occupied Gaza.

Gaza's history goes back 4,000 years. Gaza had been ruled, ruined and inhabited by various dynasties, empires and nations. Originating as a Canaanite (Hebrew) settlement, it was under Egyptian ruke for approximately 350 years, before being conquered by the Philistines and becoming one of their main cities. Many Arabs claim to be descendants of the Philistines, but the Philistines were not Semites, so this is false. It was in Gaza, according to the Book of Judges, that the Jewish strongman Samson brought down the Philistine palace and died under the rubble (**★** [Sefaria ](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.21-31) / [YouVersion](https://www.bible.com/bible/2692/JDG.16.21-31)).

Gaza was ruled by the Assyrians, Persians, Nabataeans. Alexander the Great also reached it. After a bloody assault, in which most of the inhabitants were killed, he took the city and turned Gaza into a center of Hellenistic philosophy and education. Gaza was gradually settled by Bedouins from the desert and Greeks, soldiers and traders. After the death of Macedon, two successor kingdoms of the great Alexander fought for Gaza - the Seleucids from Syria and the Ptolemies from Egypt. In 96 B.C. Gaza was besieged and captured by the Jewish Hasmonean dynasty.

When the Romans came to Judea, Pompey the Great (the same one who, together with Crassus, defeated Spartacus) recaptured it from the Jewish king Alexander Jannaeus. Under the Romans, Gaza flourished, under empire's protectorate. The city was governed by a senate of 500 members, including Greeks, Romans, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Nabataeans.

Under Herod the Great, Gaza again became a vassal of Judea. By that time, most of the people living in it were Romans and Greeks. In the first century, during the Jewish uprising against the Romans, it was destroyed again. After the defeat of the uprising in 132 AD. BC, the Romans expelled a significant number of Jews from the country and renamed the province of Judea as “Syria Palaestina”, in order to forever erase the memory of the Jewish presence in these places. This is where the name Palestine comes from.

After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Gaza fell to Byzantium. Saint Porphyrius insisted on Gaza's conversion to Christianity at the end of the 4th - beginning of 5th century, destroying the sanctuary of Gazan god Marnas, well known throughout the Roman empire (**★** and Hellenistic community ages prior, who [depicted Marnas equivalent to Zeus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnas_(Gaza)#/media/Datei:Statue_of_Zeus_dsc02611-.jpg)).

Two centuries later, Gaza was conquered by the Muslim general ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, and most of the inhabitants were forced to convert to Islam. The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Arab Fatimid dynasty in 1100, but were driven out by Saladin. By the end of the 13th century, Gaza was in the hands of the Mamluks, and became the capital of a province stretching from the Sinai Peninsula to the border with Syria. In the 16th century, Gaza came under the control of the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire for long 400 years. In 1832, the territory of Gaza was conquered for 8 years by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, eldest son of Muhammad Ali, the Wāli (governor) or Egypt. The Egyptians carried out some reforms along European lines, which caused Arab resistance and uprisings in most cities of the country, which were being suppressed by force. During this period, extensive research was carried out in the field of biblical geography and archaeology, and as a consequence thereof, we know that all this time small Jewish communities remained in and around Gaza. The Jewish presence in Gaza ended in 2005 when Israel voluntarily withdrew.

In 1917, during World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and the League of Nations (predecessor of the UN) gave Britain a mandate to govern Gaza. Good days have come - with their characteristic pedantry, the British began to restore order. In 1948, after UN Resolution 181 partitioned Palestine between Jews and Arabs, the Arabs (**★** immediately) went to war, and Gaza came under Egyptian rule.

In 1967, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula were captured by Israel during the Six-Day War. When Israel and Egypt came to a peace agreement in 1978, the Sinai Peninsula was returned back to Egypt, but the Egyptians showed little interest in Gaza. Unfortunately for Israel. During the First Intifada (a wave of Arab terrorist attacks against Israel), Gaza became a center of political activity and a major headache. The 1993 Oslo Accords placed it under the direct control of the Palestinian Authority.

In 2005, Israel voluntarily and unilaterally withdrew from Gaza, leaving the Palestinians with prosperous farmland and farms, stunning beaches and a rich fishing zone. Everything required for a happy life, in order to become a new Singapore of the Middle East. But in 2007, Hamas won the elections in Gaza and began to sow seeds of hatred on an unprecedented scale. Singapore did not work out, the farms were burned, and in their place rocket launchers appeared and shelling of the border areas of Israel began. In 2007, after three weeks of massive rocket attacks on civilians - after three weeks of shelling! – Israel began a blockade of Gaza (discover more about the blockade below). Every couple of years, in response to rocket attacks and murder of Israeli civilians, including children, Israel carried out military operations to destroy militants and artillery.

And then October 7, 2023 came. 1400 killed, raped, stabbed, burned, tortured Israelis. 230 hostages, the youngest of whom is 10 months old. 18 years after Israel VOLUNTARILY left Gaza. This is the occupation and the response to it.
